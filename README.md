# IntroToSpotipy
This was my first project using Spotipy, the Python API for Spotify. This demonstrates data collection, cleaning, EDA, and model building

This introduction to Spotipy was fairly pivotal in my data science career. It was the first time I worked with music and data, and it was what made me realize it is
possible at all. This was also where I gained confidence that I had a burning passion for data science because it was a very successful, personally intriguing, front-to-end
project covering data collection/assembly, data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualizations, model development, and machine learning practices.

Specifically, I wanted to outline the key features of songs that made the Billboard top 100 over the past 10 years. I used Pandas to create one final large data frame holding 1000 songs and their audio features. Then I was curious to compare features from an artist I like that had not made the Billboard, Earl Sweatshirt. I wanted to compare his
features to those that made mainstream popularity and see if there were any significant differences, especially inferences on what kinds of songs tend to make the top 100 every
year.
